# AppSpec Configuration for AWS Code Deploy
os: linux 

# We need to copy our artifacts over to the tomcat applications directory, which is /usr/share/tomcat<Version>/webapps
# This can be replaced with an environment variable reference defined in the 
# AWS instance - for example 
files:
  - source: SpringMVC.war
    destination: /usr/share/apache-tomcat-10.0.14/webapps

# Before the application is deployed, Tomcat needs to be stopped and 
# the existing applications cleaned up, otherwise, AWS Codedeploy will not
# overwrite the files. 
hooks:
 ApplicationStop:
   - location: stopServer
 # Now we can start up Tomcat once again
 ApplicationStart:
   - location: startServer
